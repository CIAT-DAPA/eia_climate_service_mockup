# Yield optimization using a data-driven approach
*Author: Hugo Andres Dorado*

In this project, an optimization algorithm was implemented for maize yield. For this purpose, it was used a random forest model as a fitness function, and the crop management variables iterated until finding the best combination. The optimization strategy is the metaheuristic known as the best global harmony search.

The dataset comes from crop cycles of growers, collected by Fenalce (National Federation of Grains and Legumes) and CIAT, in CÃ³rdoba, Colombia.
